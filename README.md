This project loads a list of countries, with their regions and additional details.

This version has the following features: 

* Is a single page website.
* Has filtering option.
* Content is paginated. 

The backend is consuming a single endpoint (all countries), because all the required information along the process is there. This is an improved version, based on the multiple pages website implementation. 

Most of the process takes action on the frontend.
